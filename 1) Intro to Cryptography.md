#  Introduction to Cryptography
Cryptography is the science and art of securing information. 

It ensures that data remains confidential, authentic, and unaltered when stored or transmitted over insecure channels (like the internet).

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals of Cryptography (CIA + A + NR)
| Goal                | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Confidentiality** | Ensure only authorized parties can access the data. |
| **Integrity**       | Ensure the data hasn't been tampered with.          |
| **Authentication**  | Verify the identity of the sender or receiver.      |
| **Non-repudiation** | Prevent denial of sending or receiving the message. |

# ðŸ§  Types of Cryptography
| Type               | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Symmetric Key**  | Same key is used for encryption and decryption. (e.g., AES, DES)                          |
| **Asymmetric Key** | Uses a **public key** for encryption and **private key** for decryption. (e.g., RSA, ECC) |
| **Hash Functions** | One-way functions that convert data into fixed-size digests. (e.g., SHA-256, MD5)         |
# ðŸ§  Why is Cryptography Important?
Without cryptography:
- Passwords can be stolen
- Messages can be intercepted and changed
- Online transactions can be spoofed
- Personal data can be exposed
  
In short, cryptography builds trust into digital systems.
# ðŸ“¦ Real-World Applications
- Secure communication (WhatsApp, Signal)
- Online banking & e-commerce (HTTPS)
- Digital signatures & authentication (SSL/TLS, JWT)
- Password storage (bcrypt, Argon2)
- Blockchain and cryptocurrency (hashing, digital signatures)
